*Evolution of Three.js 3D model*


wind down is a prototype for bedtime app that allows users to create a bedtime routine with the goal of improving sleep habits. The app is centered around an interactive room built in Three.js that contains objects related to the routineâ€™s activities set by the user.

**To run this app locally:**

- Fork and clone the repo
- Run ```npm install``` in the terminal after opening the repo in VS Code or your editor of choice
- Create a file called .shhh.js (this is already in the gitignore file)
- Include the text ```process.env.JWT = "yourSecretCodeHere"``` in the .shhh.js file
- Create a postgres database called ```wind-down```
- Run ```npm run seed``` in the terminal to seed the database
